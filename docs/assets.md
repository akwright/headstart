Autoprefix defaults:
```
['> 1%', 'last 2 versions', 'Firefox 28', 'Opera 12.1', 'ie 9']
```

- FF 28: that version still needs -moz to support border-box
- Opera 12.1: the last version to have the Presto render engine before they switched to Webkit
- IE9: the oldest IE browser that makes any sense to support
